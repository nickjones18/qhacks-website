We're bringing in students from all over North America to come together for a wild 36 hours - designing, developing, demoing, cup-stacking, and foosball-playing at our home base at Queen's University. Whether you're a first timer or a seasoned veteran, QHacks definitely has something to satisfy your interests. This weekend is about inclusiveness for all disciplines - students from any level of skill, from any field of study are encouraged to bring their innovative ideas for a weekend of creative problem solving! The only prerequisites for this weekend are a love for tech and drive to learn.",
